## The research effort is concluded!

I'm pleased to finally announce that the thesis discussing the background, design search process and evaluation of Procrastinot has been reviewed, graded and published [in OuluREPO](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:oulu-202509195945) concluding my work for the time being. I should be pleased: I received both the highest grade, and excellent feedback. If this project has been of interest to you, I highly recommend at least skimming through the study!

> I would like to personally thank all the participants of the study. Even though you were few, your feedback has been vital in determining the success of the design. You may become the key people behind a new and improved system later on!

## The future of this project

The evaluation of the prototype yielded results that both support and challenge the design of the system. At the time of writing I have no plans to keep working on Procrastinot. However, if I were to do so at a later date, my notes would point me in the right direction to improve the design, and implement a new and better prototype for further testing.
