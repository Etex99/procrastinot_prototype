## Thank you for taking an interest in my Master's thesis!

Target of my research is to collect thoughts and experiences of university students to evaluate the novel design of "Procrastinot": a prototype application designed to alleviate academic procrastination. The prototype application was designed and produced as part of the master's thesis effort.

**The study is targeted at currently active university students.** You can try the application briefly and join the study regardless of your past and current experience with academic procrastination. 

>Having tried the "Procrastinot" prototype application is a prequisite for participating in the survey study. The app executable is only available for Android phones (sorry iOS users) and you need to use your own available devices. Using the app is entirely independent and not a research setting. No data is collected from the users of the app. The app recides in an [open-source GitHub repository](https://github.com/Etex99/procrastinot_prototype/tree/main) and the software is licensed under [the MIT license](https://github.com/Etex99/procrastinot_prototype/blob/main/LICENSE).

Still interested in participating? Follow the steps below!

1. Read and follow the app [installation guide](https://etex99.github.io/procrastinot_prototype/instructions/2025/04/01/installation-guide.html)

2. Familiarize yourself with the [instructions for use](https://etex99.github.io/procrastinot_prototype/instructions/2025/04/01/instructions-for-use.html)

3. Try the app! In other words, try to utilise the app next time you study or do independent coursework outside of the classroom. If this is not possible, you may also pretend to be studying, but a real setting is preferred. Instructions for use include a brief description of the intended way to use the app.

4. Enter the survey study by submitting your answers **by Wednesday 14th of May 2025**! [Link to the survey on Webropol](https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/DF3734D2C682A175)
