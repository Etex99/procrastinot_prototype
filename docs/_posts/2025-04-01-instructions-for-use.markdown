Because this app is a prototype using the app is not as streamlined as one would hope and you may encounter issues.
However, great effort has been exerted to keep the user interface minimal and clear.
This post introduces the main functions of the system and **highlights certain quirks** (see the block quotes).

## In a Nutshell

The app is intended to be used as follows:

1. Each day of self-study, you may **start a study session** by tapping the large green button on the home page.
2. Then, you may **plan your study session** by entering study duration and breaks as well as three priority study tasks.
3. After confirming the plan, you may **monitor your study session** initiating study breaks and marking tasks completed as you go.
4. You may at any time **end the study session** by tapping the "red door" and receive a short **summary of your session**.
5. Depending on your study session success you may directly return to the home page by tapping another "red door" or **view session insights** by tapping the "green gear head"
6. Session insights potentially offers you helpful suggestions for improving your study habits.

Optionally, you can edit **app settings** to customise the default study plan items.
And lastly, you may view tips and strategies on the **help page for study planning** by tapping the "question mark" on the session setup page.

### App settings

Navigate to settings by tapping the "gear button" on the home page.

"Defaults" are the initial values that are always pasted on the study planning form.
In essence, if you habitually self-study for 4 hours taking a 10 minute break after each hour, you can edit the default values in the settings in order to avoid having to type them each day again and again.

> Note:
> - The study duration does not include the breaks. In the above example the total duration of the study session would roughly equal to 4 hours and 40 minutes.
> - Settings are not saved automatically. Tap the "green floppy disc" to save.

### Plan your study session

Fill all of the form fields to be able to start your study session. Yes, you must enter a strict number of three study tasks, this is intended by design!
After the form is full and valid, a "green checkmark" will appear at the bottom of the screen to confirm your choices. 

> Note:
> - Due to the implementation the "green checkmark" will only appear if the last text-input is finished by pressing "confirm" on the virtual keyboard. Hiding the keyboard by tapping "back" will not work.

### Monitor your study sessions

Mark an individual task done by tapping the "green checkmark" next to it. This action cannot be reverted.

Study breaks are taken manually by tapping the "coffee cup". Breaks will end automatically or can be ended early by tapping the "return arrow". A bell sound will indicate that the break has ended if device sounds are not muted.

End the study session by tapping the "red door". This can be done at any point in time. You should leave any undone tasks unchecked.

> Note:
> Due to technical challenges the app may not play a sound when the break has ended. This is a known issue. Completing actions described in step 3. of the [installation guide](https://etex99.github.io/procrastinot_prototype/instructions/2025/04/01/installation-guide.html) may alleviate this problem.
